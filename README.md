Repository for assignment 1 in the Intro to Machine Learning course

## Overview

This assignment has two parts:
 - Creating an EDA class to do some semi-automated data exploration. 
 - Creating a predictive tree-based model that is well fitted, using a pipeline. 

## Part 1 - EDA

The first task is to create a python utility file that contains a class that performs common data exploration steps in bulk. 



## Part 2 - Predictive Modelling with Trees
